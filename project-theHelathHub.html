        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The Health Hub is one of two group projects from the academy that I was part of. It’s a modern e-commerce
          platform built for individuals who are passionate about health, fitness, and balanced living. It offers a
          one-stop shop for everything you need to support an active lifestyle—from high-quality workout equipment and
          performance supplements, to functional fitness apparel and nutritious, clean foods.</p>
